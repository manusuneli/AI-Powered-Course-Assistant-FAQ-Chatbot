      "\n",
      "*   **Subject Line:**  This is CRITICAL.  Here are some options, tailored to different approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Benefit-Oriented:**\n",
      "        *   \"Increase [Key Metric] by [Percentage] with AI\" (e.g., \"Increase Lead Generation by 40% with AI\")\n",
      "        *   \"Stop Wasting Time on [Pain Point] - AI Can Help\" (e.g., \"Stop Wasting Time on Manual Data Entry - AI Can Help\")\n",
      "        *   \"The AI Tool [Prospect's Company] Needs to [Achieve Specific Goal]\" (e.g., \"The AI Tool Acme Corp Needs to Automate Customer Onboarding\")\n",

      "        *   \"What If You Could [Achieve a Desirable Outcome] with AI?\"\n",
      "        *   \"A New Way to [Solve a Common Problem in Their Industry]\"\n",
      "    *   **Personalized (Requires Research):**\n",
      "        *   \"Saw Your Recent Post on [Topic] - AI Can Help\"\n",
      "        *   \"Congrats on [Company Achievement] - Here's How to Scale\"\n",
      "    *   **Avoid:** Generic subject lines like \"AI Solution\" or \"New Technology.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Hi [Prospect Name]:**  Personalization is key.  Use their actual name.  If you can't find it, consider skipping the name entirely and starting with the second paragraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **[Your AI Tool Name]:**  Use the actual name of your tool.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **[Prospect's Industry/Role/Problem Area]:**  Be specific.  Don't just say \"businesses.\"  Say \"marketing teams,\" \"e-commerce companies,\" \"sales managers,\" etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **[Specifically what it does - focus on the benefit, not just the feature]:**  This is where you sell the *value* of your tool.  Instead of \"It uses machine learning to analyze data,\" say \"It helps you identify your most profitable customer segments.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **[Give a concrete example of a benefit with a quantifiable result, if possible]:**  Numbers are powerful.  Back up your claims with data, even if it's an estimated range.  \"Reduce churn by 15-20%\" is much more compelling than \"Reduce churn.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **[Acknowledge a pain point the prospect likely faces]:**  Show empathy and understanding.  This demonstrates that you've done your research and aren't just blindly sending emails.  Examples:\n",
      "    *   \"We understand that managing social media content can be time-consuming and overwhelming.\"\n",
      "    *   \"We know that generating high-quality leads is a constant challenge for sales teams.\"\n",
      "    *   \"We realize that data analysis can be complex and require specialized skills.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **[Explain how your tool directly addresses that pain point]:**  Connect the pain point to your solution.  \"That's why we built [Your AI Tool Name] to automate content creation and scheduling, freeing up your time to focus on strategy.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Call to Action (CTA):**  Make it clear what you want the prospect to do.  Offer two options: a quick call or a link to learn more/try a free trial.  Having two options increases the chances of engagement.  Make the call to action easy to act on.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **[Link to your website/trial]:**  Make sure the link is correct and goes to a relevant page (e.g., a landing page specifically designed for cold outreach).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Your Signature:**  Include your name, title, company, and website.  This adds credibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Considerations for Success:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Targeting:**  The most important factor.  Make sure you're sending this email to the right people.  Research your prospects and tailor the email to their specific needs and interests.  Use LinkedIn Sales Navigator or similar tools to find relevant contacts.\n",
      "*   **Personalization:**  Go beyond just using their name.  Reference something specific about their company, their role, or their recent activity.\n",

Change the data type of the date column to ‘Date’ if it is in ‘Date/Time’ format. Skip this step if it is already in ‘Date’ format.\\n    2. Create a new custom column in the fact_sales_monthly table. you can name it date_modified or any other name accordingly.\\n    Formula\\n    = Date.ToText([date],\"yyyy\") & \"/\" & Text.PadStart(Text.From(Date.Day([date])),2,\"0\") & \"/\" & Text.PadStart(Text.From(Date.Month([date])),2,\"0\")\\n    3. change the data type of the above-created column to date.\\n    4.

       " Document(metadata={'source': 'What is the difference between Business Analyst Vs Data Analyst', 'row': 50}, page_content='prompt: What is the difference between Business Analyst Vs Data Analyst\\nresponse: While both business analysts and data analysts work with data, they have different focuses and responsibilities. Here are some key distinctions:\\n\\n1. Focus: Business analysts focus on the business side of things, such as business processes, workflows, and strategies. They use data analysis to identify business problems, opportunities, and solutions. Data analysts, on the other hand, focus on the data itself. They collect, process, and analyze data to extract insights and make data-driven decisions.\\n2. Skill set: Business analysts need to have strong communication, problem-solving, and strategic thinking skills, as they often work closely with stakeholders and decision-makers to identify business needs and develop solutions. They also need to have some knowledge of data analysis, such as data visualization and basic statistical analysis. Data analysts, on the other hand, need to have a strong foundation in data analysis and programming skills, such as SQL, Python, etc. They also need to have a good understanding of data visualization and statistical analysis to derive insights from the data.\\n3. Tools: Business analysts typically use tools like spreadsheets, business process modeling software, and business intelligence (BI) tools to analyze data and create reports. Data analysts use more advanced tools like statistical software, programming languages, and database management systems to collect, process, and analyze data.\\n4. Outputs: Business analysts typically produce reports, presentations, and recommendations based on their analysis of the data. Data analysts produce statistical models, visualizations, and reports to help stakeholders understand the data and make informed decisions.\\n\\nI recommend watching this video by Dhaval sir which explained more details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sFRpbPKTG4&t=1s'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'Can you state the distinction among the SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), PARALLELPERIOD(), and DATEADD() function in Power BI?', 'row': 51}, page_content=\"prompt: Can you state the distinction among the SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), PARALLELPERIOD(), and DATEADD() function in Power BI?\\nresponse: Here is the brief explanation.\\n\\nSAMEPERIODLASTYEAR() compares the given period with the exact same period of last year as the name suggests. But it has a limitation like King of the chess board - it can go only compare 1 year backward for a given day, month, week, or quarter. If you want to go backward or forward or if you need to go 3 or 6 months/years/days you need to use DATEADD().\\n\\nDATEADD() is more like the queen of the chessboard. It is very dynamic as it compares a day, month, quarter, year, etc. over any specified no. of time period.\\n\\nPARALLELPERIOD() works exactly like DATEADD() but there is a minor difference. Parallelperiod() does not work dynamically like DATEADD().\\n\\nFor example, if you use PARALLELPERIOD() to get the previous month's value for dates between 1/5/2023 - 12/5/2023..it will compare these 12 days with the entire previous month of April 2023 (1/4/2023 - 30/4/2023) whereas DATEADD will compare the exact same days (1/4/2023- 12/4/2023).\\n\\nLikewise, if you use PARALLELPERIOD() to get the previous year's value for dates between 1/1/2023 - 12/5/2023..it will compare this time period with the entire previous year 2022 (1/1/2022 - 31/12/2022) whereas DATEADD will compare the exact same period (1/1/2022- 12/5/2022).\\n\\nRefer this thread for more info: https://discord.com/channels/1090613684163850280/1106528524023648326\"),\n",

However, you may be involved in designing the structure and schema of a database, as well as configuring and populating it with data.\\n\\nCreating a database usually falls under the purview of a database administrator (DBA) or a data engineer. These roles are focused on the technical aspects of database design, implementation, and maintenance.\\n\\nAs a data analyst, your primary responsibilities would typically include querying and analyzing data within an existing database, creating reports and visualizations to communicate insights, and helping to inform business decisions based on data analysis.

It is used to establish a relationship between two tables in a relational database. The primary key of one table is used as a foreign key in another table to link the data between the tables.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s say we have two tables in a database: a \"customers\" table and an \"orders\" table. The customer\\'s table has a primary key column called \"customer_id\", and the orders table has a foreign key column called \"customer_id\" that references the \"customer_id\" column in the customer\\'s table.\\n\\nBy establishing this relationship between the two tables, we can ensure that every order in the orders table is associated with a valid customer in the customer\\'s table.'),\n",
